Attention is a mechanism in artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning models like transformers, that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data that are most relevant to the task at hand. Instead of processing all input elements equally, attention assigns weights to different elements, giving more importance to those that are crucial for understanding the context or generating an accurate output.
