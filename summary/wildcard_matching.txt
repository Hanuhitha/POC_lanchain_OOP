The Python code implements a wildcard pattern matching algorithm. It utilizes dynamic programming to determine if a given input string (s) matches a pattern (p) containing '?' and '*'.  

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A 2D boolean array `dp` is created, representing all possible substrings of `s` against `p`. 
   - `dp[0][0]` is set to `True` as an empty string matches an empty pattern.
   - If the pattern starts with '*', `dp[0][index]` is set to `dp[0][index - 1]`, allowing '*' to match zero characters.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through each character of `s` and `p`. 
   - If the current characters match or `p` has a '?', `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, indicating a successful match.
   - If `p` has a '*', two possibilities are considered:
      -  `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i][j - 1]`, allowing '*' to match zero characters.
      -  `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j]`, allowing '*' to match one or more characters.
   - Otherwise, the match fails (`dp[i][j] = False`).

3. **Result:**
   - Finally, `dp[len(s)][len(p)]` holds the result, indicating whether the entire string matches the pattern.
