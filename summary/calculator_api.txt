This Spring Boot program creates a REST API for basic calculator operations. It defines four endpoints: "/add", "/subtract", "/multiply", and "/divide". Each endpoint takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, using the @RequestParam annotation. The corresponding operation is performed, and the result is returned as an integer or double (for division).  The divide endpoint includes error handling to prevent division by zero, throwing an ArithmeticException in that case.
