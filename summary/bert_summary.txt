BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a powerful language model developed by Google AI. It's pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code, enabling it to understand and generate human-like text. BERT's unique bidirectional training approach allows it to consider the context of words in both directions, leading to improved performance in various natural language processing tasks like question answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis.
