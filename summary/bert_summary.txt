BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful language model developed by Google. It utilizes a transformer architecture and is trained on a massive text dataset. BERT's unique bidirectional training approach allows it to understand the context of words in a sentence by considering both preceding and following words. This enables BERT to perform exceptionally well on various natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis.
