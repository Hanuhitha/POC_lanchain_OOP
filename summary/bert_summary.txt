BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful language model developed by Google. It utilizes a transformer architecture with a bidirectional training approach, allowing it to understand the context of words in a sentence more effectively than previous models. BERT is pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code, enabling it to perform various natural language processing tasks such as question answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis.
