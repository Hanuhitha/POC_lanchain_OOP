The Python code defines a function `countRegions` that calculates the number of regions in a grid represented as a 2D string array.  Each region is defined by contiguous cells containing either '/' or '\' characters. Blank spaces (' ') separate regions.

The algorithm uses Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid. It starts at each cell containing a '/' character that hasn't been visited yet. The DFS function recursively explores all connected cells with '/' characters, marking them as visited.  Each time a new region is encountered (starting from an unvisited '/' cell), the `num_regions` counter is incremented.

The code iterates through each cell in the grid and initiates DFS if it finds an unvisited '/' character. This ensures that all regions are identified and counted accurately.
