The Python code implements a binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left = 0`: Sets the index of the leftmost element in the search range.
   - `right = len(arr) - 1`: Sets the index of the rightmost element in the search range.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The `while left <= right` loop continues as long as there are elements to search within the current range.
   - `mid = (left + right) // 2`: Calculates the middle index of the current search range.
   - `if arr[mid] == target:`: If the value at the middle index matches the target, the index `mid` is returned, indicating the target's position.
   - `elif arr[mid] < target:`: If the value at the middle index is less than the target, the search continues in the right half of the array. The `left` index is updated to `mid + 1`. 
   - `else:`: If the value at the middle index is greater than the target, the search continues in the left half of the array. The `right` index is updated to `mid - 1`.

3. **Target Not Found:**
   - If the loop completes without finding the target (i.e., `left` becomes greater than `right`), it means the target is not present in the array, and `-1` is returned.
