This Java code defines a class named `Solution` with a static method called `fibonacci`. This method calculates the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.  

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Base Cases:** If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it directly returns `n` (0 or 1 are the first two Fibonacci numbers). 
2. **Initialization:** It creates an integer array `fib` of size `n+1` to store calculated Fibonacci numbers. The first two elements, `fib[0]` and `fib[1]`, are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
3. **Iteration:**  The code iterates from `i = 2` to `n`. In each iteration, it calculates the ith Fibonacci number (`fib[i]`) by adding the previous two Fibonacci numbers (`fib[i-1]` and `fib[i-2]`).
4. **Return Value:** Finally, the method returns `fib[n]`, which holds the calculated nth Fibonacci number.
