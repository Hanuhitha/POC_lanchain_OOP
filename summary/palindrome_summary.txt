The provided code defines a function called `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. The function uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the input string (`s[::-1]`) and then compares it with the original string using the equality operator (`==`). If the two strings are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input string is a palindrome.

The code snippet is written in Python programming language.
