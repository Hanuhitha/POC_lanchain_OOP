Region proposals are candidate bounding boxes that potentially contain objects of interest within an image. They are generated by algorithms like selective search, which identify regions based on visual cues such as color, texture, and shape. These proposals serve as input to object detection models, which then classify and refine the bounding boxes to accurately locate and identify objects.
